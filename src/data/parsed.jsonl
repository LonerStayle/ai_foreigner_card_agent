The amount of the deposit is \ngenerally 10 to 20 times the monthly rent.\n■\u0001The lessee shall pay 10% of the security deposit for the lease as a down payment and \nsettle the balance when moving in. If the lessee cancels the lease during the term of the \ncontract, the down payment shall not be returned. If the property owner cancels the \ncontract, he/she shall pay twice the amount of the down payment to the lessee.\n■\u0001\u0007In principle, the full amount of the security deposit is returned after termination of the \ncontract. In special cases, such as arrears of monthly rent or utility charges, these \nexpenditures are deducted from the security deposit, and the remaining amount is returned.\n■\u0001\u0007Real estate agent commissions vary depending on the type of residence and area, as well \nas the transaction amount.\nYou can find real estate agencies that provide services in foreign languages (mainly \nEnglish, Chinese, and Japanese) via the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s Real Estate \nInformation Center website (land.seoul.go.kr).\n03  Moving\n1  \u0007Things to look out for before moving in\n■\u0001Check the conditions of the house \nthoroughly before you move in.

It is classified as a business facility under the Building Act. However, \nmany office workers and single-person households tend to prefer this type of residence \nbecause it includes built-in furniture and home appliances for residents’ convenience. Most \nofficetels have parking lots. Officetel residents should pay management expenses every \nmonth, just like apartment residents.\n3  \u0007Detached residence\nA detached residence refers to a free-standing residential building on land owned by an \nindividual. In most cases, a detached residence is owned by one or two persons (joint \nownership).\n4  \u0007Tenement/multi-household house\nA tenement, a type of Western-style multi-occupancy building, refers to a four-story or \nlower multi-unit building consisting of two or more houses. A multi-household house is a \nresidential building where several households can live together.\n5  \u0007Studio apartment\nA studio apartment is similar to an officetel, but smaller. Studio apartments are divided into \nthe separated kitchen type and all-in-one type, depending on their structure. As the rent \nis cheaper for a studio apartment than an officetel, they are generally concentrated near \ncolleges.\n6  \u0007Boarding house\nResidents can stay in a boarding house by paying the monthly rent only, without need \nfor a deposit. The monthly rent includes housing expenses, utility charges, and breakfast \nand dinner expenses. Numerous residents live in a boarding house and should share the \nkitchen, living room, washrooms, etc. Generally, the owner also lives in the boarding house.\nMany boarding houses are concentrated near colleges.\n7  \u0007Gosiwon\nA gosiwon has the cheapest deposit and monthly rent. A gosiwon unit is very small and only \nsuitable for a single-person household. Residents share a kitchen, washrooms, showers, \netc., and may cook if they want. Many gosiwon facilities provide basic food ingredients, \nsuch as rice, eggs, and kimchi, for free.\nMake sure all utility charges and \nmanagement expenses are paid.\nPay all of your utility charges, such as electric \nbills, gas bills, and management expenses, \nand keep the receipts just in case.\nWHAT TO REMEMBER \nWHEN MOVING OUT!\nInquiries\n• City gas : 1588-5788\n• Water and sewage : 120\n• Electricity : 123", "page": 11, "source": "2024_Living_in_Seoul.pdf", "name": "Living in Seoul 2024", "year": 2024, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "02 RESIDENCE\nl 23\nGuidebook for Living in Seoul 22\n2  \u0007Gas\n■\u0001\u0007Although most homes in Seoul use city gas, some cities without city gas facilities use \nLPG. In Seoul, city gas is supplied by Seoul City Gas. If you live in a house that uses LPG, \ncall a nearby gas supplier to order gas for delivery.\n■\u0001\u0007If you want to use city gas after moving in, you should contact a city gas supplier to have it \ninstalled. A city gas company employee will visit your place and install the city gas lines on \nthe designated date.\n■\u0001\u0007It is dangerous to install and remove gas lines by yourself. It should be done by a city gas \ncompany employee for your safety.\n■\u0001\u0007Visit the Korea Gas Association website (www.citygas.or.kr) for further information on city \ngas companies near your home.\n3  \u0007Waterworks\nWater fees are charged every two months. Water fees include waterworks, sewage, and \nwater charges. Call the Waterworks Headquarters (☏120) or visit its website (arisu.seoul.\ngo.kr) [available in Korean and English] for further information.\nTip   How to prevent water meters from freezing and bursting in the winter.\nWater meters may freeze and burst when the temperature drops below freezing in the winter. Fill the \ninside of the water meter with an old cloth or towel and cover the outside with vinyl in advance to \nprevent cold air from getting in. In addition, always leave your faucets dripping to prevent the pipes \nfrom freezing.\n05  Trash Disposal\n1  \u0007Sorting trash\nSorting trash refers to separating waste into different elements, such as plastic, paper, vinyl, \ncans, and so on.\nGeneral trash and food trash that does not need to be sorted should be disposed of in a \nstandard plastic garbage bag. Through the bag fees, this system encourages recycling and \nreduces waste.\n2  \u0007Fines for violations\nSeoul’s 25 autonomous Districts, or Gus, have their own schedules for throwing out trash. \nViolating trash regulations or illegally disposing of trash could result in a maximum fine of \n1 million won. If you are caught mixing general and food trash, you could also face a fine, \nwhich accumulates based on the number of violations committed. (Regulations may vary by \ndistrict.)\n■\u0001Before you depart the Republic of Korea, be sure to pay all management expenses and \nutility charges, including electric bills, gas bills, and water fees, to avoid disruptions during \nyour immigration inspection.\n2  \u0007Moving options\n■\u0001Call van moving company : Call van moving company: If you do not have a lot of luggage, \nit is economical to use a call van moving service.\n■\u0001General moving company : If you use a general moving company, you will make a \ncontract for the use of the vehicles, and should pack and arrange your goods by \nyourself. Prices vary depending on the number of staff required for moving. The number \nof staff will be determined based on the amount of goods to be moved.\n■\u0007Full-service moving company : A full-service moving company handles the entire moving \nprocess, including packing, transport, and unpacking in the new house. You are only \nexpected to take care of your valuables, and all you have to do is to let the movers know \nhow you want the furniture and home appliances laid out when moving in. Prices vary \ndepending on the amount of goods to be moved. You may also use other services, such \nas cleaning, by paying additional charges.\nTip   What is an implied renewal?\n※You should remember this before the expiration date of your contract. If you want to move out \nwhen the current lease contract is terminated, you need to notify the owner of your intention to do \nso one month before the contract expiration date. Otherwise, the lease contract will be automatically \nextended even though a new contract was not signed. This is called implied renewal. If the owner \ndoes not wish to extend the contract with the current lessee, he/she should ask the lessee to move \nout two months before the contract expiration date so the lessee can make preparations.\nTip  Other moving services\n•\u0007If you need a place to store your freight and luggage until you move in, you can use an overseas \nmoving company’s freight storage service. Storage fees depend on the number of days your \ngoods will be stored.\n•\u0007If you want to hire a cleaning service before moving in to your new home, look up “입주청소” (move-in \ncleaning) or “이사청소” (cleaning before moving in) online.\n04  Electricity/Gas/Waterworks\n1  \u0007Electricity\n■\u0001The standard voltage in Korea is 220V, at 60Hz. You should check the voltage and \nfrequency before using electronics you’ve brought from abroad. A monthly electric bill is \nissued on the following month.
